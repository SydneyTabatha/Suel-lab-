Code for skeletonization


The first script is a first attempt. 

The second script 'time_iterate.py' is a better algorithm for skeletonization. 

The third script pixel_scrambling.py is a script where i scrambled the pixels of the original image randomly and computed the power spectrum of the scrambled image. I repeated this 10 times and took the average power spectrum and the standard deviation. I then compared this to the power spectrum of my scrambled image and saw if it fell within the standard deviation or not.
